**Juliet**: After a typical summer day in Oxford involving park walks, sun, bursts of rather violent rain, and a few pints, we wanted to have a suitably matching summer dinner.

**Matt**: Being a weekend, it seemed poor form not to eat a big slab of meat. We adapted this from a recipe we found in the FT Weekend magazine, and had tried a while back. It's a super tasty way to cook a cheap cut of meat (skirt steak), whilst giving it a real summer's kick.

**Juliet**: The real recipe was for barbecue, but having lived in England for some time now, we have successfully adapted it for the hob. We went to our local butchers and, as we usually are when we actally make it to the butchers, were surprised at how cheap a hunk of skirt steak actually is. Because we had just come from the center of town and had had few pints on an empty stomach, we couldn't really remember how much and exactly what we needed. Working on the assumption that we might end up with four for dinner, we asked for a pound and a half of skirt steak, and then popped into the supermarket to pick up the rest of the flavors - chilli, some fresh and summery herbs, lime and garlic. We knew we had balsamic and shallots at home already.

**Matt**: I could happily eat just steak, but I really shouldn't. So we also picked up what we needed for a simple leafy salad and creamy potato salad - how better to accompany summer steak?

### Potato Salad

**Matt**: You can do this as far ahead of time as you like, but I think it's best to boil the potatoes just before you cook everything else - a bit of warmth in the potatoes adds a lot. We used Charlotte potatoes, and it's best to throw in more than you think you need - potato salad makes for great leftovers. Boil them till they are just fork-able.

**Juliet**: I usually leave Matt in charge of all things meat and potatoes. He is a lot more knowledgable about which potatoes to use for what. And the charlotte potatoes were lovely. The only thing I helped with was finely dicing half a shallot (more on shallots later) and spooning some maynonnaise and sour cream over the potatoes along with some salt and pepper.

**Matt**: And that's about all there is to that.

### Chimmichurri Steak

**Matt**: First up is to make the chimmichurri, and the eagle eyed amongst you may have noticed that this isn't a real chimmichurri, because we didn't use parsley. This may have been down to us forgetting which herb we were supposed to use, but I stand by the decision - the citrusy coriander mixes in really nicely with the vinegar and onion. But anyway, here's what we did for a pound and a half of steak:

Start with the other half of your finely diced shallot. We used [echalion shallots](http://www.ukshallot.com/echalion.html) for pretty much everything we ever use onion for - in terms of taste, they're basically the perfect mixture of onion and shallots (and much easier to peel than shallots too, which is nice). Add a nice handful of finely diced coriander, too.
