**Juliet**: After a typical summer day in Oxford involving park walks, sun, bursts of rather violent rain, and a few pints, we wanted to have a suitably matching summer dinner.

**Matt**: Being a weekend, it seemed poor form not to eat a big slab of meat. We adapted this from a recipe we found in the FT Weekend magazine, and had tried a while back. It's a super tasty way to cook a cheap cut of meat (skirt steak), whilst giving it a real summer's kick.

**Juliet**: The real recipe was for barbecue, but having lived in England for some time now, we have successfully adapted it for the hob. We went to our local butchers and, as we usually are when we actally make it to the butchers, were surprised at how cheap a hunk of skirt steak actually is. Because we had just come from the center of town and had had few pints on an empty stomach, we couldn't really remember how much and exactly what we needed. Working on the assumption that we might end up with four for dinner, we asked for a pound and a half of skirt steak, and then popped into the supermarket to pick up the rest of the flavors - chilli, some fresh and summery herbs, lime and garlic. We knew we had balsamic and shallots at home already.

**Matt**: I could happily eat just steak, but I really shouldn't. So we also picked up what we needed for a simple leafy salad and creamy potato salad - how better to accompany summer steak?

### Potato Salad

**Matt**: You can do this as far ahead of time as you like, but I think it's best to boil the potatoes just before you cook everything else - a bit of warmth in the potatoes adds a lot. We used Charlotte potatoes, and it's best to throw in more than you think you need - potato salad makes for great leftovers. Boil them till they are just fork-able.

**Juliet**: I usually leave Matt in charge of all things meat and potatoes. He is a lot more knowledgable about which potatoes to use for what. And the charlotte potatoes were lovely. The only thing I helped with was finely dicing half a shallot (more on shallots later) and spooning some maynonnaise and sour cream over the potatoes along with some salt and pepper.

**Matt**: And that's about all there is to that.

### Chimmichurri Steak

**Matt**: First up is to make the chimmichurri, and the eagle eyed amongst you may have noticed that this isn't a real chimmichurri, because we didn't use parsley. This may have been down to us forgetting which herb we were supposed to use, but I stand by the decision - the citrusy coriander mixes in really nicely with the vinegar and onion. But anyway, here's what we did for a pound and a half of steak:

Start with the other half of your finely diced shallot. We used [echalion shallots](http://www.ukshallot.com/echalion.html) for pretty much everything we ever use onion for - in terms of taste, they're basically the perfect mixture of onion and shallots (and much easier to peel than shallots too, which is nice). Add a nice handful of finely diced coriander, too.

**Juliet**: Then, we added 4 finely diced cloves of garlic, half a red chilli and salt and pepper, and poured a few big glugs of balsamic over everything and let it sit. The glugs are supposed to be about 100ml. This wgas done with the very scientific method of me 'measuring by eye'. I am, after all, a scientist. 

I have to say, a lot of this was slightly thrown together mainly because we forgot the real recipe. And I was fairly surprised when we got back and dug out the notes from the recipe before. Somehow, we remembered lime, which was not called for and then not used as we stuck to the balsamic. I hadn't remembered to copy down how much the recipe serves, but how many people can eat two 2kg steaks? A small platoon? Also, the initial recipe called for red wine vinegar, but the balsamic was super tasty and a suitable substitute.  In fact, I think our substitutions improved it. 

**Matt**: With the chimmichurri prepared and happily sitting, it's time to cook the steak. We'd kept it out of the fridge so it was nicely at room temperature. Whilst waiting for the pan to get hot (very hot!) we rubbed it with salt and pepper and gave a good little coating of olive oil.

Slap the steak down into the pan. We followed the [Heston approach](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/how-to-cook-like-heston/articles/hestons-top-10-tips-for-beef) of flipping it frequently to keep the maillard reaction going on both sides, but I'm not totally convinced. I'd probably just do it for a minute on each side, then another minute on each side, then let it rest. You want to sear the outside nicely, but leave the inside nice and pink. Do it even rarer than you normally would - you're going to cover it soon with the lovely acidic chimmichurri, which will cook it a little bit too. Once out of the pan it needs to rest for at least five minutes - we took this as the right moment to get our bottle of wine open.

**Juliet**: The wine, and also the salad. This was simple; just romaine lettuce, rocket and some lovely little red and orange tomatoes. For the dressing, I added just a little olive oil and the lime that we didn't need for the chimmichurri. and salt and pepper. 

##Overall

**Juliet**: It was delicious. There was complete silence when we sat down to eat, because we were both too busy stuffing food into our mouths to comment on how good it was. 

However, there are two things I would change next time. I think we were overly cautious cooking the steak, and it would have been nicer if we had a bit more of burnt crust on the outside. And secondly, I think the salad needed a bit more sweetness besides the tomatoes to really balance out the flavors of the meal. Maybe no lime juice in the dressing, or a bit of sugar to cut some of the acidity. There was plenty already in the chimmichurri. 

**Matt**: Like Juliet said, a bit more heat in the pan would have given a nicer crust on the steak (without overcooking the middle). And best of all, lots of leftovers - it was just the two of us, but there was definitely enough steak for four. Hooray!
